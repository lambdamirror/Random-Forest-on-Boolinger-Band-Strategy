# Random-Forest-on-Boolinger-Band-Strategy

1/ Random Forest Classifier on Bollinger Bands Strategy
 
This part includes 2 steps:

	a) Calculate Bollinger Bands and create signals (sell at the up cross and buy at the down cross)
	b) Training RF classifier on the BB signals. Data used is 1 minute candles, the training set is 24 hours data, and validation set is 8 hours data

Accuracy analysis incluces: ROC curve, confusion matrix and classification report.

One can replace RF classifier by Gradient Boosting Tree classifier, or Recurrent Neural Network,... The rest of this script can be kept the same.


2/ Backtesting the Signals generated by RF Classifier

This part includes 3 steps:

	a) Generate Signals objects based on the predictions of RF classifier
	b) Generate Backtester object to calculate statistics of the trading session
	c) Plot Trades entry/exit and Equity Curve. Print out Session Summary
